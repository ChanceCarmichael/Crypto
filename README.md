# Crypto
A mathematical program to find all the ways to combine operations and numbers to arrive at a target answer.

Example:

Using the following operations: +, -, *, and \; and given the 
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 how can we find the answer 5?

( ( ( ( 3 + 2 ) \ 5 ) * 4 ) + 1 ) <br />
( ( 3 + 2 ) * ( 5 \ ( 4 + 1 ) ) ) <br />
( ( 5 - ( 4 + 1 ) ) + ( 3 + 2 ) ) <br />
( ( 5 * 4 ) \ ( ( 3 + 2 ) - 1 ) ) <br />
etc...
